4. Click play on the profile, you can exit the game as soon as you hit the main menu

## Install Mods

1. Download the latest release zip folder
2. Extract the zip folder and copy the contents into your new `.minecraft1-21-4` folder

### Mods arent loading

This is likely from the folder not being extracted properly. Ensure the contents of the extracted folder (mods, shaderpacks, ect) get added to the .minecraft folder
